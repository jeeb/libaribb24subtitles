ARIB B24 Caption parsing library

This library will enable you to parse captions from ARIB transport streams. 
Just this the functions with uint8_t arrays with the hex values inside and you'll receive a Advanced Subtitle Script line or just the text.
man-pages for the functions will follow when I figured out most of the stuff.

Plans are to also return a ass_info structure that contains screen size, line width etc. what can be read from the caption statements of the transport stream.

Currently working:
* Extracting text from subtitles
* Extracting a couple of tages (WHF, CYF, etc.)
